 checkpoints Lyrics
If I haven't heard a word in ten years, assume you\u2019re dead
Or guest of the Feds
Or cultivated a better class of friends
Not mad, tip the hat, fingers don't touch the brim
Lid don't touch my naps
Andy Capp, go \u2019head, pencil him in
Last one standin', what he scream in the wind
At the end, at-at the end
Verses like somethin' Fred Sanford said
Skits like, \Is he dead?\
While Shameek really layin' in the street
Dark comedy dog, I beat 'em in the head
Win what? I'm just tryin' to beat the spread
Quit my job to kick raps instead
So family meeting, everybody gotta start bringin' in bread
Shot the movie, no script
Scoured the Heights, no piff
Came home like, \It\u2019s no recipes left\
Kid\u2019s like, \No shit\
Came home like Okonkwo at the end
At the end, nigga just quit
Whitey finally in that spaceship like, \So long, and thanks for all the fish\
I calmly rolled another niggastick
Woman stopped me like, \It's still other shit to fix\
\True this, sis, go \u2019head, I'll be up in a bit\
I'm chillin' like Africans who never felt the whip
Dish served room temp, Escovitch fish
Always better when you pry it out they cold, dead grip, grip
You might also like
Pace the palace wing, dethroned king jump when the phone ring
Egyptian cotton, but you can\u2019t sleep, not a wink, not a wink
You can't blink, not a wink
You can't blink, not a blink
Dethroned king can't sleep, not a-
Not a blink, not a blink


My goals was limited, just wanted to be the best
Just somethin' to get from one day to the next
Best tour advice I ever got, \You better off beatin' ya dick\
Readin' your Bible, sweat beadin' on your lip
FBI agents listenin', Dr. King
Motel bed spring, this some freaky shit, freaky shit
Andrea Dworkin back of my mind, can't get it in without internet
Connection, connectin' against God, we formed weapons
'79, they stormed Mecca, the devil ambidextrous
Pony had one trick, no sweat
Watch plainclothes search for that elusive marijuana cigarette
Roulette wheel spin, no more bets
No surprise, the rich suggest you do more with less
Your revolution left the niggaratti unimpressed
Don't wait, dig the pits
Purge the leadership, don't hesitate
Ain't no half-steppin', step to 'em like
\You know what it is\1Embed
